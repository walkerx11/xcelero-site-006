    a: "Individual investors from $500 via the xCelero Fund. No accreditation required. SPV Syndicates and Thematic Funds require qualified investor status depending on jurisdiction. Anchor Mandates are for institutional investors and family offices.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does xCelero deploy capital?",
    a: "We deploy across five vehicles: (1) xCelero Fund, broad exposure across the full portfolio; (2) SPV Syndicates, single-deal co-investments alongside institutions; (3) Thematic Funds, concentrated sector bets in energy, food, independent tech; (4) Catalyst Notes, revenue-linked returns for revenue-stage ventures; (5) Non-Dilutive Desk, grants and incentives matching across 39 countries.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the fees?",
    a: "xCelero Fund: 1% management fee, no carry. SPV Syndicates: 1% management + 10% carry above hurdle. Thematic Funds: 1.5% management + 20% carry above 8% hurdle. Catalyst Notes: no management fee, return target 1.5–2.5x. No sales load on any vehicle. See offering documents for full expense ratios.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does liquidity work?",
    a: "The xCelero Fund offers quarterly redemption windows (up to 5% of NAV per quarter). SPV positions are illiquid until exit event. Thematic Funds may offer semi-annual tender offers at Board discretion. Catalyst Notes have a defined 24–48 month duration. Consider all positions illiquid and invest only capital you can commit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is this a fund-of-funds?",
    a: "No. xCelero Capital originates and builds ventures directly. We are a venture studio that deploys capital into our own creations, not a passive allocator. When we co-invest through SPVs, it's alongside institutional partners we've selected, not into blind pools.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the investment thesis?",
    a: "Critical technology, energy, food, water, defense, manufacturing, not SaaS arbitrage. Global South-first markets where infrastructure gaps are the opportunity. Revenue-adjacent ventures with working prototypes and pilot customers, not slide decks. Route-connected companies that leverage the 190-hub network for scale. Self-sustaining by design technology that enables self-determination, not dependency.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can international investors participate?",
    a: "Yes. xCelero Capital structures investments through Mauritius HoldCos and UAE Free Zone entities to accept global capital. US investors access vehicles via Reg D offerings. African investors can participate through mobile money rails and local agent networks in select jurisdictions.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is NAV calculated?",
    a: "Portfolio valuations follow ASC 820 fair value measurement. Early-stage ventures are valued at cost until a material financing event. Revenue-generating ventures use a mix of revenue multiples, comparable transactions, and discounted cash flows. The fund is audited annually by an independent registered public accounting firm.",
